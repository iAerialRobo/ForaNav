# ForaNav: Insect-inspired Online Target-oriented Navigation for MAVs in Tree Plantations
## Overview
ForaNav is an insect-inspired, online target-oriented navigation system designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) operating in tree plantations. The system integrates real-time tree detection with bio-inspired navigation strategies to enable efficient and autonomous UAV flight in cluttered environments.

This repository contains two main components:

[Tree detection](#Tree_Detection)**: Implementation of tree detection using our proposed method and lightweight deep learning approaches.

Navigation: The navigation framework leveraging the detected trees for MAV path planning.
