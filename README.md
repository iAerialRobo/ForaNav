# ForaNav: Insect-inspired Online Target-oriented Navigation for MAVs in Tree Plantations
## Overview
ForaNav is an insect-inspired, online target-oriented navigation system designed for Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) operating in tree plantations. The system integrates real-time tree detection with bio-inspired navigation strategies to enable efficient and autonomous UAV flight in cluttered environments.

This repository contains two main components:

[Tree detection](https://github.com/iAerialRobo/Online-Target-oriented-Navigation-for-Micro-Air-Vehicles-in-Tree-Plantations/tree/59a8627617de2e210af7e12cd6dd247c16fb667e/Tree_Detection): 
Our navigation strategy draws inspiration from insect foraging behavior , particularly the reliance on local visual cues and their body-centered frame of reference for position estimation and efficient movement.
